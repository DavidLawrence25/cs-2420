# CS 1410 - CE Adv. Programming

A collection of all assignments written by Rose Thorne for CS 1410, which is/was instructed by Kim Murphy.

## File Locations & Nomenclature

For clarity (and to keep Rose accountable), here are the rules she is meant to follow regarding naming files and stuff.

- **Repo Header Files:** `custom_libraries/name_of_lib.h`
- **Repo Library Implementation File:** `custom_libraries/name_of_lib.cc`
- **Project Header Files:** `<no_brainers | labs>/XX_assignment_name/name_of_lib.h`
- **Project Library Implementation Files:** `<no_brainers | labs>/XX_assignment_name/name_of_lib.cc`
- **Main C++ Files:** `<no_brainers | labs>/XX_assignment_name/main.cc`
- **Executables:** `<no_brainers | labs>/XX_assignment_name/main.exe`
- **Markdown Files:** `read_and_report/XX_unit_name.md`

###### note that `XX` refers to the unit the assignment was in, padded with a zero to keep it aligned to two digits

## Note on Style Choices
