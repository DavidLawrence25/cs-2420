# CS 2420 - CE Algorithms & Data Structures

A collection of all assignments written by Rose Thorne for CS 2420, which is/was instructed by Kim Murphy.

## File Locations & Nomenclature

For clarity (and to keep Rose accountable), here are the rules she is meant to follow regarding naming files and stuff.

-   **Repo Header Files:** `custom_libraries/name_of_lib.h`
-   **Repo Library Implementation File:** `custom_libraries/name_of_lib.cc`
-   **Project Header Files:** `<assignment_type>/XX_assignment_name/name_of_lib.h`
-   **Project Library Implementation Files:** `<assignment_type>/XX_assignment_name/name_of_lib.cc`
-   **Main C++ Files:** `<assignment_type>/XX_assignment_name/main.cc`
-   **Executables:** `<assignment_type>/XX_assignment_name/main.exe`

###### note that `XX` refers to the unit the assignment was in, padded with a zero to keep it aligned to two digits

## Note on Style Choices

This repository follows the Google C++ Style Guide, which has been ported to Markdown for convenience.
